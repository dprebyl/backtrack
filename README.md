# BackTrack

Notify your emergency contacts if you don't make it home by the time you expect. Useful in a variety of emergency scenarios, from getting lost to car crashes.

This is a project developed for HackKU 2022. The app is developed using React Native for cross-compatability. It is powered by a Twilio backend for sending SMS and phone calls and uses NodeJS.

Stretch goals:
- Location tracking for automatic disarming
- Recurring times for automatic arming
